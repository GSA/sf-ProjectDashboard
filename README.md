## Overview
Many Project Portfolio Managers have difficulty reporting valuable project information to high level executives in a clear and concise manner. They also have difficulty gathering the necessary information from Project Managers to fulfill this reporting requirement. Most managers rely on presentations to communicate status, but updating these can be laborious and time consuming. Also, emailing Project Managers for status updates becomes cumbersome; and a constant annoyance to both PM’s and portfolio managers. Also, PM’s may not have the time to type an update every week to send to the portfolio manager. All of this leads to poor data quality, and poor reporting. To solve this, the Project Dashboard application was created.

Salesforce was chosen to host the Project Dashboard because of it’s ability to be easily customized, it’s ease of use, and it automated email functionality. This allows for very robust dashboards to be created and customized for executive consumption as well as enable status reminder emails.

The Project Dashboard contains a visualforce page, that quickly displays high priority projects as well as key project information for easy executive consumption. It also allows for more detailed information consumption as time allows. The page can also be sorted on any of the status criteria, enabling executives to quickly drill into any project that is of interest and understand it’s progress.

Another key part of the Project Dashboard is the ease of use for Project Managers. Email reminders are sent to the PM’s for their specific projects requesting status updates. Project Managers can then from there create a project pulse with any required update quickly and easily and submit for approval to portfolio manager. The information collected here will be reflected in the project and the dashboard once approved.

Finally, the Project Dashboard allows for final approval from the portfolio manager, in case there is a mistake in an update; portfolio managers can also edit all updates prior to approval to fix spelling errors etc.

The Project Dashboard allows for a comprehensive view of a portfolio of projects and makes it easy for the Portfolio Managers to gather and produce information to executives. If you have additional questions, please reach out to the contact information provided.
